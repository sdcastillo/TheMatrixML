Below is a sample SciLab script that demonstrates how to implement and estimate the same Gaussian GLM (linear model) using the normal equations. This example reads a design matrix X (from model_matrix.csv) and a numeric response vector y (from y.csv). Each file is assumed to be purely numeric with no header row.
